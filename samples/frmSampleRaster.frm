'pd2D Basic Raster (Bitmap) Sample Project
'Copyright 2016 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 01/July/16
'Last updated: 01/July/16
'Last update: continued work on initial build
'
'This small form should help you "hit the ground running" when it comes to pd2D capabilities.  Here's what you
' need to know:
'
'1) When your project starts, you must initialize a pd2D backend before doing any painting tasks.  This involves
'   placing one line of code inside Form_Load or Sub Main():
'
'   PD2D.StartRenderingEngine P2_DefaultBackend
'
'2) When your project ends, you need to release the backend you started inside Form_Load or Sub Main(), e.g.:
'
'   PD2D.StopRenderingEngine P2_DefaultBackend
'
'3) pd2D is based on a simple drawing model: a PAINTER uses PENS and BRUSHES to draw on various SURFACES.
'   For simplicity, this project declares a single painter instance at form-level.  The painter's name
'   is "m_Painter", and it handles all interactions betweens PENS, BRUSHES, and SURFACES.
'
'4) Drawing occurs on surfaces (the "pd2DSurface" class).  There are two primary ways to create a surface:
'
'   - You can wrap a surface around an existing VB object, like a picture box or form.  This lets you paint
'     directly onto that object, but you must be aware of VB behavior with properties like .AutoRedraw.
'     (For example, if .AutoRedraw is set to TRUE, you must use a line of code like
'     "PictureBox.Picture = PictureBox.Image" to force the picture box to update.)
'
'   - You can also create an unlimited number of "in-memory" surfaces.  These surfaces are not tied to
'     any on-screen object, which makes them both very fast, and capable of supporting very large sizes.
'     However, to see the contents of an in-memory surface, you will eventually need to paint it onto a
'     surface that *is* tied to the screen (like a form or picture box surface created via the first method).
'
'   In this demo, I'll use a combination of these two methods to demonstrate how "back-buffering" works.
'   Specifically, I will create two surfaces:
'
'   - An in-memory surface at the same size as the sample form's large black picture box.  This surface is called
'   "m_BackBuffer", and I will perform all painting tasks on this surface.  Because this surface is not tied to
'   an on-screen object, it never needs to synchronize with the screen -- so painting to it is instantaneous.
'
'   - To show our painting results on-screen, I will periodically copy the contents of "m_BackBuffer" into a
'   second surface, called "m_TargetPictureBox".  This surface is created by wrapping a pd2Dsurface object around
'   the main form's black picture box, using the helpful PD2D.QuickCreateSurfaceFromDC() function.
'
'5) When performing drawing tasks, you'll probably create lots of pens and brushes.  You never need to worry
'   about destroying these resources.  pd2D takes care of this for you.  The same goes for in-memory surfaces,
'   because pd2D has full control over those.
'
'   The one exception to the "don't care about destroying resources" rule is surfaces that are wrapped around
'   normal, on-screen VB objects like picture boxes or forms.  These surfaces need to be destroyed before the
'   underlying object is destroyed, or you may run into trouble.  (This is not normally a problem unless you are
'   creating and destroying controls as run-time -- but please be aware of it!)
'
'6) To simplify the most common pd2D tasks, I've created a lot of helper functions inside the master Drawing2D
'   module.  These functions are prefixed with "Quick", e.g. "PD2D.QuickCreateSolidPen", which lets you
'   create a solid-colored pen for painting in just one line of code.  You'll probably want to make use of these,
'   as they can save you some trouble over manually instantiating pens and setting individual properties one line
'   at a time.
'
'I think that's everything!
