'Last update: continued clean-up of PD-specific code

'To improve performance, pd2D falls back to GDI in cases where GDI behavior is functionally identical.  This module
' manages all GDI-specific code paths.
'
'(I should probably mention that some non-GDI bits also exist in this module, like retrieving data from hWnds which
' actually happens in user32, but it doesn't really make sense to split those into their own module.)
