'This interface provides a means for interacting with various GDI+ features.  GDI+ was originally
' used as a fallback for image loading and saving if the FreeImage DLL was not found, but over time
' it has become more and more essential to PhotoDemon .  As of version 7.0, GDI+ is deeply embedded
' into PD's rendering pipeline, as it's currently the easiest+fastest way to reasmple 32-bpp pixel
' data regardless of underlying PC features.  It is also used extensively in rendering PD's custom UI.
'
'Jose Roca's convenient GDI+ reference has been a huge help with GDI+ development:
