'PhotoDemon String Builder class

'Last update: initial build
'
'I was going to delay construction of a string builder until post-7.0, but I ran into some issues with the
' pdGradient class and serializing huge gradient node collections, so it made sense to write a little
' string builder sooner rather than later.
'
'VB6's problematic string performance is well-studied, and I'm sure there are more comprehensive solutions
' to this problem out there, but like most other classes in this project, it's nice to have a PD-specific
' solution that does exactly what we need (no more, no less).
'
'Instead of wrapping an array, note that we directly buffer an underlying BSTR.  This simplifies some
' operations that are otherwise tedious (e.g. using built-in VB string operations, checking buffer length,
' ensuring null-termination).  This also allows us to use internal VB string functions, where desired,
' although this class may still preferentially choose various string APIs for performance reasons
' (e.g. to avoid searching large stretches of null chars at the end of the buffer).
'
'Functions are (roughly) modeled after .NET's StringBuilder class:
' https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder(v=vs.110).aspx
' ...but with the usual modifications to imitate things like function overloading.
